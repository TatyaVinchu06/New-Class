    # 🎓 CORE Campus

    CORE Campus is a modern, responsive web-based Learning Management System (LMS) prototype designed to streamline interaction between students and faculty. It features a clean, unified interface for managing assignments, resources, classes, and doubts.

    ## 🚀 Features

    ### For Students
    - **Dashboard**: View upcoming deadlines, notifications, and daily schedule.
    - **Assignments**: Submit work, check grades, and view feedback.
    - **Resources**: Access study materials (PDFs, Videos, Links) organized by subject/unit.
    - **Doubts**: Ask questions and get answers from faculty or peers.
    - **Workspace**: A dedicated area for focused study.

    ### For Teachers
    - **Faculty Dashboard**: Overview of active batches, pending reviews, and schedule.
    - **Class Management**: specific views for each class (e.g., DBMS, DAA) with stream/announcements.x
    - **Assignment Management**: Create, edit, and grade assignments with file upload support.
    - **Student Tracking**: Monitor student progress and submissions.

    ## 🛠️ Technology Stack
    - **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3 (Modular & Utility-based), Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+).
    - **Styling**: Custom CSS architecture with shared utilities (`utilities.css`) and component-based styles (`tables.css`, `profile.css`).
    - **Icons**: FontAwesome 6.
    - **Fonts**: Inter & Outfit (Google Fonts).
